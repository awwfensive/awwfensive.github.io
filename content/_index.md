I’m Aniket, a cybersecurity researcher and offensive security builder. I currently work as a Penetration Tester (Intern) @ [we45](https://www.we45.com/), where my focus is breaking systems the way real attackers do—not the way scanners expect.

My work lives in the gaps: web application security flaws, logic bugs, access control failures, and architectural weaknesses that compliance checklists and automated tools routinely miss. I [research vulnerabilities](/blog), build [exploitation tooling, design adversarial labs](/projects), and create Capture The Flag challenges that model real-world attack paths from entry point to impact.

This site is a record of my research, experiments, and the lessons learned from breaking systems end-to-end.
