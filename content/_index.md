I’m Aniket, a cybersecurity researcher and builder focused on offensive security. I currently work as a Security Development Intern @ [we45](https://we45.com/).

My work centers on web application security, vulnerability research, and system design failures that don’t show up in scanners or compliance reports. I build [tools, design adversarial labs, and create Capture The Flag challenges](/projects) to expose how real attacks work in practice.

This site is a record of my research, experiments, and the lessons learned from breaking systems end-to-end.
